- You are most yourself when you're chasing horizons together.

Combine these into a single 400-500 character insight.
Use a direct, punchy tone. Make it feel like a personal callout, not a horoscope.
Avoid phrases like "you express" or "this placement suggests."
Avoid em dashes (—). Use commas, periods, or semicolons instead.

If this placement has a clear shadow, cost, or trade-off, include it. Show how this strength alienates others or creates tension.
If this placement is genuinely harmonious or lucky, celebrate it without forcing a downside.
Astrology should feel true, not flattering—but also not artificially negative.
